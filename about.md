## Code of Conduct

### Purpose

The Cyber Security community should be truly open and welcoming for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all sponsors, speakers, attendees, media, exhibitors and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive conference experience for everyone. All determinations of appropriate or inappropriate behavior are in AtlSecCon’s sole discretion and the decision(s) of the AtlSecCon representatives on-site will be final.

 
### Expected behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.

* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior, materials and speech.

* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

 
### Unacceptable behavior & materials include, but are not limited to:

* Unacceptable behaviors & materials include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning materials or conduct by any attendees of the event and related event activities. Many event venues are shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### Consequences of unacceptable behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, media, speakers, volunteers, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or exhibitors. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.

 
### What to do if you witness or are subjected to unacceptable behavior

If you are subjected to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subjected to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify event staff, Venue staff or an AtlSecCon Board Member as soon as possible. All reports will remain completely confidential.

Event Staff will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the conference. You can report unacceptable behavior to any member of staff. Staff can be found in the Show Office onsite or you may email one of the contacts below.

## DerbyCom Network

Our goal is to forge alliances with existing chapters, conferences, and communities as well as build and forge new ones where needed in order to drive the same type of conference, community, and difference DerbyCon created. With DerbyCon communities, we help support an industry through multiple methods including providing assistance in promotion, finding sponsors and speakers.

The DerbyCon network is a chapter, conference, or kids meeting with the same core values of positivity + inclusiveness, knowledge sharing, and charity dedicated to the betterment of the information security industry.

DerbyCon started off as a group of individuals that started a small-scale conference located in Louisville Kentucky back in 2011 and lasted 9 years with over 3,000 attendees. DerbyCon was known for its core family values and community and is now focused on creating a network of groups who’s mission is to make a difference and impact for the betterment around the world in regards to information security.

Regardless if you are an already established chapter or conference or looking to start a brand new one, as long as the core principles are met for DerbyCon Communities, you are welcome.
